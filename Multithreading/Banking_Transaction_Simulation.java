/*
Create a Java program to simulate a bank system with a shared account balance.

Task:
Initial account balance = 10,000
Create two threads:
Thread 1 → performs 5 withdrawals (random amounts between 500–2000)
Thread 2 → performs 5 deposits (random amounts between 500–2000)
Requirements:
Both threads should operate on the same account balance
Print updated balance after every transaction
Ensure balance never goes negative
Hint:

Think step-by-step:

Shared resource = balance variable
Use synchronization concept (important idea: avoid race condition)
Each thread modifies same data
Control access carefully
